README for the Foot Locker Coding Assesment. 

In this exercise, I was tasked with creating, from scratch, a replica of a wireframe of a single html page.

Technology used:
HTML5
CSS3
SCSS
Node


Notes:
Since working mostly with Bootsrap and other CSS frameworks with my cuurent company, I am a little rusty with creating custom styles and SCSS. I wanted to make sure to get the responsivness of the page over all completed and I wanted to get most of the components in the HTML. I also put focus on the NAV bar and the hamburger menu. In two hours, I was able to complete most of the responsiveness and was able to customize certain components. Overall, I am quite pleased with the amount of work that was completed in the two hours and thoroughly enjoyed digging into custom CSS/SCSS and loved the experince of this task.
